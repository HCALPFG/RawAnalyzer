RawAnalyzer
===========

CMSSW package looks at DCC payloads, raw decoding

to use:  set your directory to where you want in the CMSSW world:

for example, if you are working in CMSSW_7_1_3, then from your home directory:

cd CMSSW_7_1_3/src/subsystem/

(make the subsystem directory if you don't have it already)

then type:

git clone git@github.com:HCALPFG/RawAnalyzer.git

that brings everything over.  Then cd into RawAnalzer and you can do scramv b and cmsRun and so on.
